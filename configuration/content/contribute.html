<p>
(Before submitting data you must have a <a href= "/Admin/userapplication.php" >morphbank user account</a>)<br />
There are several ways in which a user or a group of users can upload images to morphbank:
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Using the existing web interface.</b> Images are uploaded separately along with their associated text information by filling out web forms.  The web upload process is described in detail in the <a href="/About/Manual/">morphbank User's Manual</a>.  You must log in and choose a group before being able to submit.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Delivered uploading via a customizable <a href="/Help/Documents/">Excel Workbook</a>.</b> This is the latest method released for Morphbank Contributors to use for data upload. It focuses on fields from the main Morphbank objects: Image, Specimen, Locality and View. The Workbook and Instructions for populating each field are found under <a href="/Help/Documents/">Delivered Uploading</a>. Fields in this workbook are also DarwinCore2 (dwc v1.2) fields. Users of this method are also able to enter <b>user-defined fields</b> to accommodate data where there is no existing Morphbank field that fits. In this instance, Contributors are <em>strongly encouraged</em> to try and find a field in one of the following Schemas that match the requirements. Using standard Schemas greatly facilitates data-sharing between computers, aka <em>interoperability</em>.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/tdwg_dw_core.xsd" target=_blank>Darwin Core XML Schema</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/tdwg_dw_curatorial.xsd" target=_blank>Curatorial Extension to the Darwin Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/tdwg_dw_geospatial.xsd" target=_blank>Geospatial Extension to the Darwin Core</a></li>
</ul>
Morphbank encourages Contributors to try this method. It may be possible in the near future, via <a href="http://services.morphbank.net/mb3/" target=_blank>Morphbank Services</a> for users to upload and update their data directly using this workbook.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Delivered uploading via a modular (object-oriented), multi-page Workbook.</b> Morphbank provides an already prepared Excel data entry <a href="/Help/Documents/">worksheets</a> and the corresponding workbook <a href="/Help/Documents/">manuals</a>. The contributors can send to morphbank a CD containing images and an Excel data entry worksheet populated with information.  We also have ftp upload.

  <b><i>How to save and send the files</i></b>
  <br /><br />
  For each image set with a unique release date, create a separate folder. Name each folder: ImageCollection1, ImageCollection2, etc. Inside each folder, place the morphbank Excel workbook and all associated images. The <a href="/Help/Documents/">workbook manuals</a> should be followed carefully to prevent errors in your upload.     

  You can send your data to the morphbank admin team in two ways:
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
    <li>Save all image collection files on a CD and send to morphbank admin team by land mail (see address below). Make sure to keep a backup copy for yourself and send with proper postage and protection.</li>  
  
    <li>Secure FTP upload.  Morphbank provides a secure ftp (sftp) upload service as an alternative to mailing CDs/DVDs.  Registered morphbank users may email <b>mbadmin <font color="blue">at</font> scs <font color="blue">dot</font> fsu <font color="blue">dot</font> edu</b> for password, username and address.  Although you should be familiar with sftp, only minimal experience is necessary to use this service.  The Morphbank server may be accessed through any graphic sFTP program, terminal or the command line.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
Once a morphbank administrator has sent your account information you may begin uploading. Be sure to use sftp as the transfer protocol. There is no limit on the number of files uploaded at one time.  Once the images are on the server email mbadmin at scs dot fsu dot edu and let us know that your file transfer is complete and if you would like the account to remain open.  Morphbank will delete the files off of the server once they have been received and the account password changed if the account is not requested to remain open.  This service may be used once or many times depending on the user\'s specific needs.
</p>
<p>
When we receive images it may be a few weeks before upload; a member of the morphbank admin team will contact you in order to check your image upload or follow up with corrections to your Excel workbook.  For further information about these options contact the morphbank admin group at <b>mbadmin <font color="blue">at</font> scs <font color="blue">dot</font> fsu <font color="blue">dot</font> edu</b>
