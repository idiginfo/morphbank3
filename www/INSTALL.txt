1) Checkout code from SVN:
   svn checkout http://biodivimage.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/biodivimage/trunk/mb32 mb32
   This will create a directory called "mb32" on your machine including all required 
   directories and files.

2) Alter my.cnf and set "innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 5000" and restart mysql server.
   When running populateMB32.sql, this prevents a timeout occuring.
   
3) Create database by logging in as root user:
   [prompt]$ mysql -u root -h localhost -p
   Enter password:
   mysql> create database MB32;

3) Create user for MB32:
   mysql> GRANT ALL ON MB32.* TO user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';

3) Change to database:
   mysql> use MB32;

4) Run below SQL scripts from inside project folder:
   mysql> source configuration/dbscripts/createTablesMB32.sql
   mysql> source configuration/dbscripts/createObjectProcs.sql
   mysql> source configuration/dbscripts/createProcs.sql
   mysql> source configuration/dbscripts/populateMB32.sql (*note: A sample database named MB30 is required)
   
5) Alter my.cnf and set "innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 5000" and restart mysql server.

6) Change /www/htaccess.txt to .htaccess and save. 
   Alter the php auto_prepend_file path inside .htaccess accordingly for your server.

7) Chmod /configuration and /log directories to be writable.

8) Visit the url of your site (e.g. http://your_site.com). You should automatically be directed 
   to the install script.

9) Fill out the install form and click submit. This will create a config.ini file in 
   the /configuration/ directory. If you wish to edit configurations after installing, 
   use a text editor to make alterations to the config.ini file.
   The APPLICATION_PATH is automatically defined in the following files:
   /configuration/app.server.php
   /configuration/image.server.php

5) Chmod /configuration directory so it is not writable.

6) The folder /configuration/content/ contains site specific files you will need to alter. 
   This includes metakeywords, metacontent, and various informational pages used on the site. 
   The files contain information related to the Morphbank installation as examples, and 
   should be changed according to your own installation.

7) The Team url page (http://yourdomain.com/About/Team) requires images 
   of your team. These images should be uploaded to /www/About/Team/pictures/, and named according 
   to the value used in the MBTeam database table.
