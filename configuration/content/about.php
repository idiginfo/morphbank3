<b><?php echo $config->appName ?></b> is a continuously growing database of images that scientists use for international collaboration, research 
and education.  Images deposited in <?php echo $config->appName ?> document a wide variety of research including: specimen-based research in 
comparative anatomy, morphological phylogenetics, taxonomy and related fields focused on increasing our knowledge about 
biodiversity. The project receives its main funding from the Biological Databases and Informatics program of the National 
Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0446224" target=blank>Grant DBI-0446224</a>). 
<br /><br />
<?php echo $config->appName ?> was established in 1998 by a Swedish-Spanish-American group of entomologists and is currently housed at the 
School of Computational Science (SCS) at Florida State University.  The project has grown immensely since its beginnings 
and presently includes a team of 15 biologists, computer scientists and information scientists who are working on developing 
the software.  <?php echo $config->appName ?> is dedicated to using open-source software and is a Fair Use Web Site.  The software used in the 
current <?php echo $config->appName ?> system includes <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="blank">PHP</a>, 
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="blank">ImageMagick</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="blank">MySQL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="blank">Apache</a>, 
<a href="http://www.java.sun.com/" target="blank">Java</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/" target="blank">JavaScript</a>.
<br /><br />
Overall, <?php echo $config->appName ?> facilitates research efforts by making it possible to store, discuss and share detailed images of 
specimens from all over the world. Currently, <?php echo $config->appName ?> holds more than 216,000 public images of more than 4500 different 
species.  Many more images are in the system that are presently not public, but are held private until the contributing 
scientists are ready to release the images.  These images to document characters and features to describe organisms, make 
observations about the organisms, or make a comment about the images themselves. The set of morphological features unique 
to a specimen can be used to identify future specimens.  New species are discovered and described by looking at images in 
<?php echo $config->appName ?> and extinct or very rare specimens are preserved for current and future generations to study.
<br /><br />
<?php echo $config->appName ?> is an excellent source of information for identification of biological specimens.  In taxonomy, descriptions of 
new species or other nomenclatural acts can be documented by images and image comment tools in <?php echo $config->appName ?>. Biologists who 
use <?php echo $config->appName ?> can mark an image, make comments about images that are seen by other researchers often continents away.  
<?php echo $config->appName ?> provides stable Web links to image collections for use in online and traditional print publications.  Large 
biological inventory projects can use <?php echo $config->appName ?> to share image information about morphological types and allow experts to 
do remote identification.
<br /><br />
Beginning with <?php echo $config->appName ?> version 2.7 character and character information can now be recorded using a specific type of 
collection.  Users can create character states and use the collection slide-sorting software to illustrate characters or 
as a tool to effectively use images for character discovery.  The ability to create these characters exist now in the system 
and will soon be able to use these in matrices, and export in Nexus format. 
<br /><br />
Part of the <?php echo $config->appName ?> mission to promote sharing of information in the biological community with the public but also with 
other biologists by creating a set of Web tools to make this easier.  A public outreach collaboration,
<a href="http://marybrogan.morphbank.net" target="blank"> <?php echo $config->appName ?> at the Mary Brogan</a>, is ongoing with the Mary 
Brogan Museum of Art and Science to explore the public implications and utility of a educational tool like <?php echo $config->appName ?>.  
<br /><br />
<?php echo $config->appName ?> is working towards <a href="/About/Collaborations/">collaborating</a> 
with many research projects to develop a better community resource. A few of these collaborators include: 
Herbarium at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Systematic Entomology 
Laboratory  USDA-ARS, Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium, PlantCollections Project, and many National Science Foundation 
Assembling the Tree of Life (ATOL), Partnership for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy (PEET) and Planetary Biodiversity 
Inventory (PBI) projects.  Our 
<a href="/myCollection/?id=142482"><?php echo $config->appName ?> image diversity collection</a> highlights these projects 
and many more.
