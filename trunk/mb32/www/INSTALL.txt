The below is done after installing the database scripts.

1) Change htaccess.txt to .htaccess and save. Alter the php auto_prepend_file path accordingly for your server.

2) Chmod /configuration so it is writable.

3) Visit the url of your site (e.g. http://your_site.com). You should automatically be directed to the install script.

4) Fill out the install form and click submit. This will create a config.ini file in the /configuration/ folder. 
	If you wish to edit configurations after installing, use a text editor to make alterations to the config.ini file.
	The APPLICATION_PATH is automatically defined in the following files:
	/configuration/app.server.php
	/configuration/image.server.php

5) Chmod /configuration directory so it is not writable.

6) The folder /configuration/content/ contains site specific files you will need to alter. This includes metakeywords, 
	metacontent, and various informational pages used on the site. The files contain information related to the Morphbank 
	installation as examples, and should be changed according to your own installation.

7) Related to number 3 above, the Team url page (http://yourdomain.com/About/Team) requires images of those members on 
   your team. These images should be uploaded to /www/About/Team/pictures/, and named according to the value used in the 
   MBTeam database table.
