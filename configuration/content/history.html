<h1>Morphbank History</h1>

<p>
	The morphbank concept was originally outlined as part of a collaborative effort to elucidate higher-level 
	relationships in the parasitic-wasp superfamily Cynipoidea. This effort was planned in 1997-1998 by (in 
	alphabetical order) Jose Luis Nieves-Aldrey (Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid), Juli Pujade-Villar 
	(Universitat de Barcelona), and Fredrik Ronquist (Uppsala University), together with their PhD students 
	(in alphabetical order) Felix Fontal-Cazalla (Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid), Johan Liljeblad 
	(Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm), and Palmira Ros-Farre (Universitat de Barcelona). Fredrik Ronquist 
	first presented the morphbank project at an open lecture with international participation at Uppsala University in 
	February of 1998 and at an international Hymenoptera Phylogeny Workshop in March of 1998. The first major set of 
	images was added to the database in October to December of 1998 by Felix Fontal-Cazalla and Matt Buffington (then a 
	student of Bob Wharton and Jim Woolley at Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, TX, USA). These early images 
	were mostly of eucoilines (Cynipoidea: Figitidae). Johan Liljeblad later added an even larger set of images, mostly 
	of gall wasps (Cynipidae), the other major family of Cynipoidea. Smaller, but nevertheless critical contributions to 
	the database, involved all the original participants in the project. Matt Buffington was particularly important in 
	developing the morphbank concept and presented the image database at several meetings in the US and elsewhere in 
	2000 to 2002.

<p>
	Originally, images were arranged in folders according to the current classification of the Cynipoidea and were 
	available for viewing and downloading through anonymous FTP and from 2000 through a web portal. In 2002-2003, 
	Johan Hultgren (now at <a href="http://6thgear.se">6th Gear</a>) worked together with Johan Liljeblad on a more 
	sophisticated web interface for the image database. The new interface was presented by Fredrik Ronquist at the 
	International Congress of Systematics and Evolutionary Biology in Patras in September of 2002, as part of the 
	MorphoBank [sic!] session initiated by the American MorphoBank team, an independent image data-basing project. 
	The interface was made available online in February of 2003.
</p>
<p>
	The first paper based on morphbank images was published in Cladistics in 2002 (18:154-199) and was co-authored by 
	the original morphbank group plus Matt Buffington and G&ouml;ran Nordlander at the Swedish University of 
	Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. The paper presented the first analysis of higher eucoiline relationships and was 
	based on almost 150 morphological characters coded from some 1,100 morphbank images. The availability of morphbank 
	for general uploading of images from the user community was announced in the summer of 2003 in Systematic Biology. 
	Several important contributions of images to the database since then are highlighted in the news section of the 
	morphbank <a href="/">home page</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In the spring of 2004, the major hub of morphbank development moved from Uppsala University in Sweden to the School 
	of Computational Science (SCS) at Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL, USA. A development team involving 
	computer scientists, mathematicians, biologists and information specialists was formed. The team was instrumental 
	in expanding the scope of the database to cover many more groups of organisms and new use cases, such as the 
	documentation of natural history collections, image vouchering of DNA sequenced specimens, and the sharing of images 
	used for morphometric analysis. The site of the master server was moved in the summer of 2004 to SCS.

	The creation of morphbank would not have been possible without support from the Swedish Research Council (to 
	Fredrik Ronquist), from the National Science Foundation PEET program (to Bob Wharton and Jim Woolley), and from 
	the Swedish Institute (to Felix Fontal-Cazalla). From the fall of 2003, morphbank has been supported by the School 
	of Computational Science and Information Technology, later the School of Computational Science, at FSU (to Fredrik 
	Ronquist) and the National Science Foundation (PEET grant to Bob Wharton and John Heraty; AToL grant to Michael 
	Sharkey and colleagues; Biological Databases and Informatics Program grant to Fredrik Ronquist and colleagues).
